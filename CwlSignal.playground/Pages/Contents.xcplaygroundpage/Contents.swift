# CwlSignal Playground

## Build instructions

This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme. To satisfy this requirement:

1. You must open the CwlSignal.playground from inside the CwlSignal.xcodeproj (do not open this playground on its own).
2. Make certain the "CwlSignal_macOS.framework" is built by selecting the CwlSignal_macOS scheme (from the "Product" → "Scheme" menu or the scheme popup menu if it's available in your toolbar) and choose build ("Product" → "Build").
3. You may need to close and re-open any playground page before it will pick up the newly built framework. Close an already open playground page by pressing Command-Control-W (or selecting "Close [Name of page].xcplaygroundpage" from the File menu) before clicking in the page in the file tree to re-open.

Failure to follow these steps correctly will result in error similar to "could not build/find module 'CwlSignal'".
